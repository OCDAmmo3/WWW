# Wild West Warehouse

#### The best place to shop for all your cowboy needs.

The Wild West can be a dangerous place. On this site, you'll find everything you need to survive out there with all the outlaws and rattlers you may run across. Feel free to add anything to your wagon and look around at all the interesting things our shop has for y'all.

#### Tests
* How did we run tests?
  * A lot our tests were made through Supergoose, an extension we use to test out routes with fake requests to mimic real deployment.
  * Other tests include database testing to make sure that something is properly saved to the database after the product or user has been created.
